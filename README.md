# Application Data Grids

PHP classes to abstract the rendering of HTML tables, with 
switchable renderers and a straightforward fluid and chainable 
API.

> for the default and Boostrap 5 renderers.

## Viewing the examples

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `composer install` to install the dependencies.
